Beneficiaries of my cocktail hobby often ask what spirits they can bring over to help stock the bar.
The answer is: I appreciate everything. So, bring a bottle you enjoy, and we'll make something
delicious.

That said, if you'd like some additional direction, what follows are the bottles that get used most
often—I'd keep these in my speed rack, if I had one. There should be at least one of these at any
liquor store.

**Whiskey**: Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Rittenhouse 100 Proof Rye

**Gin**: Plymouth, Tanqueray, Beefeater

**Brandy**: Pierre Ferrand Cognac 1840, Laird's 100 Proof Apple Brandy

**Rum**: Plantation 5 Year Rum, Flor De Cana 4 Year Rum Extra Seco

**Agave**: El Tesoro Reposado Tequila, Del Maguey Chichicapa Mezcal

**Fortified wine**: Punt e Mes, Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth, Dolin Dry Vermouth, Lillet
Blanc, Cocchi Americano
