The following are referral links for the services I use and recommend. If you buy something using
one of these links, typically both you and me will get a bonus of some kind. What exactly that bonus
is tends to change over time, so this list is likely out of date in that regard. Also, there are
often many terms & conditions that need to be met to earn us the bonuses, which I have omitted here; you've
been warned.
