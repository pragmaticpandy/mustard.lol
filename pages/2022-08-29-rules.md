When learning a new board game, and one person, who has played the game like probably once, badly
mansplains the rules, I die a little bit inside.

New players should just read the rules independently in silence. It's faster and better.

That's all this page is for—links to download the rules to games I play often. There are also some
acceptable video explanations. Here they are:

* [Terraforming Mars](tm-rules.pdf)
* [Terraforming Mars Turmoil rules](turmoil-rules.pdf) & [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fyxb9JcrL8)
